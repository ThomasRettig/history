# Note

These are some _very_ plain HTML/CSS files for a _very_ old school project written a _very_ long time ago.
The typeface used for body text is [Commissioner](https://github.com/kosbarts/Commissioner) by Kostas Bartsorkas. Headings are set it [Truculenta](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Truculenta).

## Project status
Once upon a time, I had the ambition to include interactive elements such as a media gallery in the website. Alas, the project had a tight deadline and I hardly had any knowledge of Javascript back then. As such, this repository is no longer maintained. Feel free to check out the code anyway.
