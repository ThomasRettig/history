# Note

These are some _very_ plain HTML/CSS files for a _very_ old school project written a _very_ long time ago.
The typeface used for body text is [Commissioner](https://github.com/kosbarts/Commissioner) by Kostas Bartsorkas. Headings are set it [Truculenta](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Truculenta).

## Project status
No longer maintained. But feel free to check out the code.
